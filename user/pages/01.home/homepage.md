### Hello, my name is Thomas !

I'm a Computer Science engineer student specialized in Computer Graphics, picture processing and Virtual/Augmented reality.
Welcome on my personnal website, here you can find all interesting information about me and my work.

#### Currently seeking for a final internship !

I would like to work in a place and in a company where I can be happy and improve my skills. My dream is to work in Montréal, Québec, in a Game Studio. This internship is an opportunity to come and live in this city and maybe, if I feel good, call this place home.

If there is a free place for an intern in your company, please send me an email !
